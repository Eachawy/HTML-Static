			<h1>Grand Hotel Kronenhof</h1>
				<p>

						Built in the late 19th century in neo-Baroque style and with a history dating back to 1848, the 5-star superior Grand Hotel Kronenhof in Pontresina offers panoramic views of the Bernina glaciers and Engadine Mountains, a luxurious spa, and an award-winning restaurant.

As member of Swiss Deluxe hotels, all of the elegantly furnished and luxuriously equipped rooms feature wired and wireless internet access. Rooms either look out onto the mountains and glacier or the courtyard and village.

The Grand Restaurant (dress code: jacket or dark suit), where half-board dinners and breakfast are served by a friendly hotel staff, is decorated in an elegant neo-Baroque style. It serves traditional Swiss and international dishes. The more informal à-la-carte Kronenstübli gourmet restaurant (dress code: smart casual) currently holds 17 Gault Millau points and 1 Michelin star. Guests can also enjoy light menus and drinks on the wooden terrace of Le Pavillon. Grand Hotel Kronenhof was awarded as GaultMillau Hotel of the Year in 2008. The wide range of restaurants guarantees culinary variety.

The Kronenhof Spa with over 2,000 m² features a lavish pool, a children's pool, a wellness bath area, a Finnish sauna, a bio sauna, a stone grotto steam bath, a saltwater grotto, a relax floating-bath, a Kneipp footpath, a relaxation room with fireplace, 13 treatment rooms, as well as a fitness centre with state-of-the-art equipment

For children older than 3, the hotel has its very own children’s club and children's restaurant. Professional babysitting services are provided. During summer season, children up to 12 years stay free of charge in an extra bed.
